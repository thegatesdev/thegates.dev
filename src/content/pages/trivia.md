Here are some random facts and questions about me.

## What's with the name?

Originally, my go-to tag and name was `TheGates`.
Once I encountered some websites where this tag was already taken,
I prefixed it with `dev` to stand out.

*The Gates* references a set of characters I used to draw and animate.
They were basically my version of the stick figure.
[You can find them here in some old Scratch projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MTK2006/).
The name comes from their (castle) gate like shape.
