The internet is big, here's where you can find me:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/thegatesdev/), the code repository. *Surely you would've found this already.*
- [Minecraft](https://namemc.com/profile/TheGatesDev.1), the block game. *I go by the username `TheGatesDev`.*
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/thegatesdev), a Minecraft modding community.
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@thegatesdev), Google's addition machine. *I post absolutely nothing.*
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/thegatesdev/), the coding platform for kids. *And nerds, apparently.*
- **Discord**, the definition of vendor lock in. *My tag is `@thegatesdev`*.
