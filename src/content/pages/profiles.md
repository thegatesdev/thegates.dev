The internet is big, here's where you can find me:

- [thegates.dev](https://thegates.dev), the pixels you are currently staring at.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/thegatesdev/), surely you would've found this already.
- [Minecraft](https://namemc.com/profile/TheGatesDev.1), with the username `TheGatesDev`.
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/thegatesdev), the modern Minecraft modding platform.
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@thegatesdev), where I post absolutely nothing.
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/thegatesdev/), the coding platform for kids. And nerds, apparently.
- **Discord**, with the user tag `@thegatesdev`.
