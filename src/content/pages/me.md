I am a software developer from The Netherlands.
I write code as a hobby, for my studies, and to earn a living.
Other pastime activities include playing Minecraft, making art and learning Japanese.

## The Programming side

I write code.

No-- I develop software.
I just like the first phrase, because *code* sounds misterious.
Software is something you use every day. Very boring.
We shall combine both: *programming is writing misterious code to develop boring software.*

Yes, I do this every day. It's my [job](/img/job_application.jpg), my [hobby](https://github.com/thegatesdev) and my study.
I chose programming because it requires creativity, knowledge, simple steps and `structure`.
Programming is art, code is the tool.

*I should say: one of the tools.*

## The Minecraft side

I occasionally play the block game.

That's what I would say if I were a good liar.
In practice, Minecraft requires either good friends, or a lot of time and dedication.
We won't talk about the friends, but most of my effort goes into other things nowadays.
Let's redefine 'occasionally' as: a few weeks once a year.

*Hmmm, I bet this new domain would look great when that happens again...*

## The Art side

I draw things.

That's what I would say if I were a good liar.
A digital tablet does not come with a *free skill package*.
I've drawn things. After each such thing, I am sure I will never be able to make something as good again.
Hopefully sharing creations will make the process more fun.

*100 sketches a day, huh?*

## The Japanese side

えーとー、こんにちは

That's what I would say if I was in Japan in the year was 2030.
To achieve that goal, listening to podcasts and going through a textbook will have to do for now.
The Japanese language is so much fun, I love the usage of intonation and the sounds of the words.
Don't forget the great culture-- especially for autistic people.

*虹」は私の好きな言葉。*

## The Netherlands side

I live there.

Really, does a perfect country exist?
There's so much to be grateful for.
You could almost start complaining about never having to complain.

*The daily conversations with the frog from the nearby pond are also quite insightful.*
