This is a drawing of a sleepy seal, made some time ago for no apparent reason.

There's a few things I like about it.
The shape is exactly what I was going for,
although he's probably fatter than a normal seal
(I wasn't using a reference).
I'm also impressed by the matching perspective of the seal and the box.
Two other nice parts are the face and the fish.
The whiskers and eye look really cute,
and the fish are just colorful. Because colors are awesome.

Since I was mostly playing around with how highlights work,
we can learn a lot from the other parts of the drawing.
The gift tie is odd, as if I don't know how ties work (as if...),
and background gradient fades towards black (without adjusting the hue or saturation).
Lastly, the lines on the box are rushed.
