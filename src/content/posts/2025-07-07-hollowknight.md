This is a drawing of the knight and shade from Hollow knight.
I made it as a profile picture for a friend of mine.

The overall style of Hollow Knight is pretty similar to how I draw often,
but what struck me in the references was the use of highlighting on top of the lineart.
The full black fill of the 'void' merges with the lineart, so it's not that apparent on the knight itself,
but I did use this technique on the sword.

In the official game art, the cloak is rendered in a more realistic way, which I don't know how to do.
The environment is less visible in a profile picture, so I did try to apply that finer style to the foreground.

Mostly on accident, I applied a global border gradient to the image.
It may be hard to spot, but it made a big difference in the overall feel.
That means we have another skill to learn!

*Unconfirmed sources want you to know Hollow Knight is the best game.*
*The author has not responded to these claims.*
