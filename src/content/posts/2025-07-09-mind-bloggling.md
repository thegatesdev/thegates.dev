Have you ever experienced something?
Chances are, you have. You're a human after all.
You should write those experiences down.

## What is this about?

I will convince you to write.
In line with the theme, it's about writing blogs.
Blog haters are welcome to read on however.

Let's see, we have rants, we have tips, and... more tips about writing.
I'm not into tipping, so I will instead present you with secondary reasons to write.

## Language, Steve!

Language is awesome.
An incredible amount of things come together, from the linguistics itself to who you are as a person.
Researchers are still perplexed at the complexity of it all, even to this day.
I am more so by the fact that there is two words with 'plex' in one sentence.

Nowadays, lot's of people forget consuming language is only one part of the whole.
Reading books is seriously good for you, and so is listening to podcasts.
However, in essence, humans are creative beings.
Talking is *not* the same as listening. Writing is *not* the same as reading.

Every moment you are awake, you see, hear, feel, and smell things.
You pump your brain full with quick video's, sound messages, news stories...
but all of this information needs to be processed.
Most people leave this to night time, or occasionally skip it altogether.
In this age, I think writing is starting to become even more crucial.

## Mind bloggling

First of all, writing helps you remember events.
Of course, having notes helps in case you forget something.
But in fact, the act of writing itself improves the memory of the experience it is writing about.
You probably knew this already, but I have a feeling this could be applied more.

Next, writing improves gained knowledge.
Your brain amazing at connecting dots, but it benefits from as much angles as possible.
Putting down ideas from your head will make them feel more manageable, and more likely to have an impact.

Writing also requires cognitive skills like focus, planning and organization.
That means you can train these skills by writing often, helping you in other area's of your life.

## Time Machine

Another one of the above skills is self reflection.
Self reflection is an essential part of personal growth, and is linked to mental health improvements.
While making blog posts or writings, you are creating a valuable archive for yourself.
If I must give one tip, it would be to look back on your old work.
Don't bash it, just take note of how much you improved and what can still be made better.
For bonus points, write a blog post about it!

## Invisible Impact

Even if you are not blogging about original, incredible and trendy things, it can still have impact.
The author of the book Atomic Habits was inspired by an old, unknown blog post about the topic.
Without knowing it, you could be influencing decisions of other people.

## The Magical Shakespeare Smile

If you're convinced the previous points don't benefit you,
the pen (who am I kidding; the keyboard) has one final trick up it's sleeve:
Writing about your emotions and thoughts is known to improve happiness,
and can even be linked to long term physical recovery!

## Tangent: Handwriting

If you're keen on training your skull contained mass even more,
handwriting is proven to multiply the positive effects of writing.
If you're stuck on finding the perfect software for writing down notes or journaling, try out a physical notebook.
You can take it anywhere, it has no recurring fees and doesn't need to charge!

## Midnight

Once again, thanks to the great people over at Astro.
The fact I stayed up until 1AM for a silly chained blog post is pretty baffling to me.
I hope you learned something, remember to stay hydrated and get enough sleep!

See ya.
