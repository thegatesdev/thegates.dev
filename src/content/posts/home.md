:wave: Welcome to `thegates.dev`, my personal website! People usually call me Tim around here. Scarily generic, I know...

I am a software developer from The Netherlands.
I write code as a hobby, for my studies, and to earn a living.
Other pastime activities include playing Minecraft, making art and learning Japanese.

On this website you can find writings, blog posts and art pieces I've made.
Feel free to look around! I hope I can provide something useful or entertaining.
